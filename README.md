# Congo-Game-AI

## A minimax algorithm that plays a chess variant called congo.


### Base minimax agent(minimax.cpp):
* A basic minimax implementation with simple evaluation function.

### Alpha-Beta pruning agent(alphaBetaPruning.cpp):
* Uses alpha-beta pruning to reduce searched space and thus enable deeper searching for the agent in each game iteration.


### Final improved agent modifications(mod.cpp):
* Iterative deepening search.
* Evaluation function modified to take into account king's safety.


Note: All other files are the various agents playing against each other.
